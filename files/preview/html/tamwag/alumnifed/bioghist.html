                  <p>The Alumni Federation of New York University was incorporated in 1921. Officially,
                     the Alumni Federation united what had previously been separate alumni groups from
                     the different schools and colleges of the University. Prior to the formation of the
                     Alumni Federation, the General Alumni Association existed but with little or no mandate
                     to coordinate the administration of alumni activities. The Alumni Federation Board
                     of Governors was organized with 21 members from the different alumni groups, with
                     the largest schools contributing the most representatives. By 1940, amendments to
                     the Alumni Federation constitution replaced the Board of Governors with a Board of
                     Directors and increased its membership. Representatives to the Board were chosen based
                     on a “Class” system, where larger associations, in Class A, contributed more representatives
                     and had more power on the Board than Classes B and C.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Alumni Federation oversaw the involvement of alumni within the University, hosted
                     events and activities, and administered the Alumni Fund. Awards and honors like the
                     Great Teachers Award were given out by the Alumni Federation to individuals for their
                     achievements and contributions to the University. The Alumni Federation also published
                     newsletters and magazines like the 
                     <em>Alumnus</em>.
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 1980s, the relationship of the Alumni Federation and the University became
                     strained. The University desired to have more control over the Federation’s fundraising
                     efforts, especially in engaging with younger alumni and connecting with alumni outside
                     of the New York metropolitan area. The University requested, after a special review,
                     that the Alumni Federation staff director report to the President of the University
                     in addition to the Federation's Board of Directors. This request was made to justify
                     the $2.7 million in annual assistance the University gave the Federation. In January
                     of 1985, the Alumni Federation decided to become an operationally independent organization
                     and by that autumn, it was no longer recognized and its activities no longer endorsed
                     by the University.
                  </p>
                  <p>By 1995, the Alumni Federation had been significantly restructured and was mainly
                     administered by alumni from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The last Board of Directors
                     minutes in the collection date from June 22, 1995.
